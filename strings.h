    "PSXDEV is a website for PlayStation 1 (PSX, PS1/PSone) and Net Yaroze Development. Here, you can find PlayStation 1 tools from the early 1990s, advanced system information, disassembly and reverse engineering projects, circuit diagrams, manuals, help, guides, and tutorials. You can also meet some of the most intellectual and prominent programmers of the console and former Net Yaroze members. New users interested in PlayStation 1 development are always welcome. To create games and software for PlayStation 1, follow the Psy-Q Software Development Kit (SDK) guide. This is the official PSX SDK used by licensed Sony developers to make games. We recommend starting with the Psy-Q SDK, which is well-documented and includes everything needed for creating 2D and complex 3D programs. As an alternative to Psy-Q, you can look into PSn00bSDK by Lameguy 64. It's a modern open-source competitor that's almost a direct substitute.",
    "There's another community named PSX.Dev. This is a community specifically for PlayStation 1 homebrew, where discussions about PlayStation 1 development, hacking, and reverse engineering can be held on Discord. Explore the various options and check out the 'Getting started' page to commence development for the PS1.",
    "The project utilizes PSn00bSDK by Lameguy64 (https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK). It's an alternative to the leaked official development environment, PSY-Q SDK, and is a commendable effort to counteract its illicit nature by attempting to make it open-source. Utmost gratitude and respect to them.",
    "For the project, I've largely repurposed material from Bandwidth. He is an outstanding YouTuber (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp1RaZ3HmejKl723qlKOAw).",
    "I've used references from lo-fi future for circuit bending points (https://www.lofifuture.com/).",
    "The 3D model was generated with the assistance of GPT4, which provided a program to export C code from Houdini. While it might have bugs, that's to be expected. Additionally, most of the source code has been generated by GPT, and the text has been translated and proofread by GPT.",
    "The displayed graphics aren't intended to represent anything, but rather, their purpose is to be destroyed.",
    "To introduce homebrew games, I've incorporated PSNee V8 (https://github.com/postal2201/PSNee_V8). I chose to develop on the SCPH5500 due to its operational stability, accessibility, and understanding of bending points. However, Japanese consoles are more secure compared to other countries' versions, and the ideal Mod Chip wasn't developed for a long time.",
    "Given the ease of Mod Chip installation, I considered importing a foreign console, but it now costs multiple times more than it did four years ago. This likely reflects the effect of the weak yen and the decrease in availability. Even in Japan, where one could buy a set of 10 units just for the shipping cost on Yahoo Auctions four years ago, such bargain deals no longer exist.",
    "From what I've observed, the PS1 Homebrew community was most active just before 2020 (I'm unfamiliar with the Netyaroze era). The spread of the leaked PSY-Q SDK in the 2010s and the release of useful development tools by brilliant hackers like Lameguy64 on forums might be the reason. It's not just a retro community; it continues to thrive based on current technology.",
    "Net Yaroze (also known as Netto Yarōze) is a development kit for the PlayStation video game console. It was a promotional offering by Sony Computer Entertainment for computer programming enthusiasts, launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Initially named 'Net Yarouze', it was changed to 'Net Yaroze' in late 1996. 'Yarōze' means 'Let's do it together'. Invented by PlayStation's founder, Ken Kutaragi, the Net Yaroze (DTL-H300x) package, priced around $750, included a special black debug PlayStation unit, a serial cable to connect the console to a personal computer, and a CD containing PlayStation development tools. Users needed to provide a personal computer (IBM PC-compatible or Macintosh; NEC PC-9801 was also supported in Japan) to write and compile computer code and to send the program to the PlayStation. While Net Yaroze was neither the first nor the only official consumer console development kit, with the PC-Engine Develo preceding it and WonderWitch following it, the GP32 was able to run user programs right out of the box. Additionally, many earlier consoles (like Astrocade, Famicom) offered limited programming capabilities in BASIC dialects. Although there's no direct successor to Net Yaroze on subsequent PlayStation platforms, Sony's Linux for PlayStation 2 and YA-BASIC provided similar capabilities for hobbyists and amateur developers on the PlayStation 2 console.",
    "Self-contradiction",
    "The serial port is a desire. It is prepared in search of an unseen world realized by entrusting external devices with processing beyond the processing by a single CPU in the game through UART.",
    "Literally pursuing a free community brings literal destruction of order and internally disintegrates.",
    "Destruction is necessary to create a new order.",
    "In the realm of 3D graphics, while they endeavor to emulate tangible realities and their surroundings, the glitches—the ruptures in representation—hold no affinity to the latent essence of the objects they seek",
    "The history of PS1 homebrew aims to collect all the games and software created by unofficial developers for the Sony PlayStation (PSX, PS1). The PlayStation homebrew includes games created as part of the official Net Yaroze program.",
    "For the PS1 homebrew development environment, there is PSn00bSDK. It is an open-source homebrew software development kit made up of a C/C++ compiler toolchain and a set of libraries providing an abstraction layer on raw hardware.",
    "The PS1 homebrew community also has the r/psxdev subreddit on Reddit. Here, information is provided on Playstation 1/PSX programming, Homebrew discussion, and creation. Additionally, Archive.org has a PlayStation (PSX) Homebrews collection that collects all games and software created by unofficial developers.",
    "PSn00bSDK is an open-source homebrew software development kit for the original Sony PlayStation, consisting of a C/C++ compiler toolchain and a set of libraries that provide a layer of abstraction over the raw hardware. A CMake-based build system, CD-ROM image packing tool (mkpsxiso) and asset conversion utilities are also included.",
    "At the core of PSn00bSDK is libpsn00b, a set of libraries that implement most of the functionality of the official Sony SDK (excluding higher-level libraries) and several new extensions. Most of the basic APIs used by homebrew apps and games with the official SDK are available, making PSn00bSDK an ideal starting point for those wanting to transition away from Sony tools.",
    "PlayStation 1 (PS1) is a home game console released by Sony in 1994 and has become a memory for many game enthusiasts. Compared to modern game consoles, it is quite primitive.",
    "The PS1 has I/O ports for connecting controllers and memory cards, but there are some noteworthy points about the serial port.",
    "In the realm of 3D, there seems to be a slight gap between the communities of software hackers and hardware hackers. Both of these modding cultures, while cherishing consumerism, are obsessed with breaking its order and becoming free. They are creating an acid communism in the sandbox of capitalist pleasure.",
    "PsNee, an open source stealth modchip for the Sony Playstation 1",
    "While trying to destroy the normal operation of the hardware, it is also trying to establish it as an exhibition.",
    "A glitch is not a representation of retromania, a fanatical love for past styles or old things. It accumulates as a literal scar for hardware and data.",
    "Now we are ready to solder our wires to the motherboard. The best part about this mod is how easy it actually is. Sony produced these boards with large, well-spaced-out test points (presumably for 'bed of nails' testing in the factory). Just tin these points with some new solder and solder your new wires in. Take extra care once you have soldered to these pads though not to move the wire around too much and lift the pad up. I eventually heat shrink my wires together then super glue the outer of the heat shrink to a bit of the PCBs ground plane. This means if a wire needs to be replaced it's easy enough, but it also keeps them very secure.", "Circuit bending is inherently disruptive, yet its operation must remain unpredictable. While it's easy to fatally damage the CPU and incapacitate the console, the true art lies in carefully avoiding a fatal blow, leaving it in a suspended state of life.",
    "I'm bending using an analog switch IC, but the glitch effect isn't as pronounced as when I patched manually."
